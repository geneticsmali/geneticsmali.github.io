                  The goal of my research is to identify chromosomal abnormalities in children with polydysmorphic syndromes, and in infertile men. For many years these disorders 
                  have been neglected in the Malian population, probably because of the lack of knowledge about their cause and the limited taught genetic classes in medical schools. 
                  In defining the genetic basis of these disorders, I intend to increase public awareness about these disorders, and re-orient government interest toward funding research 
                  in this field. Because some neurological disorders are caused by chromosomal abnormalities, my current activities in Dr. Landoure’s project include performing karyotype 
                  and FISH analysis. In addition, my position as teacher at the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technology further qualifies me to work in the current project.</p>

                  I am a trained geneticist and molecular oncologist. My research experience is mostly based on cancer. I had done most of my Ph.D on studying telomeres. 
                  First, we established a linked between some chromosomal abnormalities and individual telomere lengths in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). 
                  Next, we demonstrated that the three dimensional nuclear architecture of Telomeres can be used to differentiate telomerase-positive cells to those using alternative lengthening.Finally, we showed that the mutation TP53-R175H of P53 protein is more likely to cause higher levels of genomic instability 
                  chromosomal instability and disruption of 3D nuclear architecture of telomeres than some other P53 mutants.I have been working with Dr Landoure team to extensively study neuro genetic disorders. 
                  Because of the previous grant, we have set up a genetic laboratory having two sectors: molecular genetic laboratory and cytogenetic laboratory. The purpose of these 
                  laboratories is to be able to carry out all of the future genetic testing in Mali for subsequent research studies. In those laboratories, we will developed some 
                  clinical tests to enhance Malian diagnostic platform. Moreover, these laboratories will serve as training sites for students and health care practitioners.</p>
