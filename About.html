" The goal of my research is to identify chromosomal abnormalities in children with polydysmorphic syndromes, 
and in infertile men. For many years these disorders have been neglected in the Malian population, 
probably because of the lack of knowledge about their cause and the limited taught genetic classes in medical schools.
In defining the genetic basis of these disorders, I intend to increase public awareness about these disorders, 
and re-orient government interest toward funding research in this field. Because some neurological disorders 
are caused by chromosomal abnormalities, my current activities in Dr. Landoure’s project include performing karyotype 
and FISH analysis. In addition, my position as teacher at the University of Sciences, Techniques and 
Technology further qualifies me to work in the current project.

I am a trained geneticist and molecular oncologist. My research experience is mostly based on cancer. 
I had done most of my Ph.D. training on studying telomeres. 
First, we established a linked between some chromosomal abnormalities and individual telomere lengths in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
This work was the first to extensively study the length of individual telomeres in cancer. 
Subsequently, we studied the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of individual telomere
lengths, the structural changes of telomeric DNA, and the nuclear architecture of telomeres in CML. 
Next, we demonstrated that the three dimensional nuclear architecture of Telomeres can be used to 
differentiate telomerase-positive cells to those using alternative lengthening. We also showed 
that DNA damaging agents could disrupt 3D telomeric nuclear architecture and shelterin gene expression. 
Finally, we showed that the mutation TP53-R175H of P53 protein is more likely to cause higher levels of 
genomic instability chromosomal instability and disruption of 3D nuclear architecture of telomeres) than some other P53 mutants. 
I did also translation research by studying telomeric nuclear architecture in breast cancer for my postdoctoral research. 
Our finding indicate that the profile of telomeric nuclear architecture is better to predict disease free survival 
in luminal A and Luminal B subtypes of breast cancer. I have been working with Dr Landoure team to extensively 
study neuro genetic disorders. Because of the previous grant, we have set up a genetic laboratory having two sectors: 
molecular genetic laboratory and cytogenetic laboratory. The purpose of these laboratories is to be able 
to carry out all of the future genetic testing in Mali for subsequent research studies. In those laboratories, 
we will developed some clinical tests to enhance Malian diagnostic platform. Moreover, these laboratories 
will serve as training sites for students and health care practitioners.

For last few years I have been interested in the clinical research, and have collaborated with Dr. Landoure 
in their SMN copy number determination in Mali project. 
Since I have been back, I have seen and collected families with hereditary neurological 
conditions that may well be investigated in the proposed project which is “Clinical and genetic studies 
of hereditary neurological disorders in Mali”. In addition to my clinical experience, 
I have lot of experience doing electroneurophysiological evaluations, including EEG and EMG, 
and I can bring this experience to help characterize the families. I believe that I am well qualified to participate in this project.

next-generation sequencing analysis and cell culture study. Dr Diarra early research project investigated “Clinical and genetic 
spectrum of hereditary spastic paraplegia in Mali” as medical thesis at USTTB, Bamako, Mali and found novel variants but also several 
families with negative screening for all known clinically relevant genes. 
From 2018 to 2021 she awarded postdoc visiting-fellow position at Dr. Kenneth Fischbeck lab's, at the National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and stroke (NINDS), Neurogenetics branch, National Institute of Health (NIH), U.S.A. 
Her project study at NIH was focus on Malian families with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) features with negative screening data. 
Salimata’s worked on the functional characterization of putative new gene discovered in a Malian consanguineous family with early onset
