including peripheral neuropathies, ataxia, myopathy and spastic paraplegia. 
His work has led to the characterization of new clinical entities, and the 
discovery and characterization of the gene for several neurological diseases, 
a work published in high impact journals. He is also collaborating with other 
researchers on the genetics of non-syndromic hearing loss in the African population. "

" The goal of my research is to identify chromosomal abnormalities in children with polydysmorphic syndromes, 
and in infertile men. For many years these disorders have been neglected in the Malian population, 
probably because of the lack of knowledge about their cause and the limited taught genetic classes in medical schools.<a href="#more">Read More</a></p>
<div id="more" style="display:none;"> <p>
In defining the genetic basis of these disorders, I intend to increase public awareness about these disorders, 
and re-orient government interest toward funding research in this field. Because some neurological disorders 
are caused by chromosomal abnormalities, my current activities in Dr. Landoure’s project include performing karyotype 
and FISH analysis. In addition, my position as teacher at the University of Sciences, Techniques and 
Technology further qualifies me to work in the current project. "

" I am a trained geneticist and molecular oncologist. My research experience is mostly based on cancer. 
I had done most of my Ph.D. training on studying telomeres. 
First, we established a linked between some chromosomal abnormalities and individual telomere lengths in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).<a href="#more">Read More</a></p>
<div id="more" style="display:none;"> <p> 
This work was the first to extensively study the length of individual telomeres in cancer. 
Subsequently, we studied the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of individual telomere
lengths, the structural changes of telomeric DNA, and the nuclear architecture of telomeres in CML. 
Next, we demonstrated that the three dimensional nuclear architecture of Telomeres can be used to 
differentiate telomerase-positive cells to those using alternative lengthening. We also showed 
that DNA damaging agents could disrupt 3D telomeric nuclear architecture and shelterin gene expression. 
Finally, we showed that the mutation TP53-R175H of P53 protein is more likely to cause higher levels of 
genomic instability chromosomal instability and disruption of 3D nuclear architecture of telomeres) than some other P53 mutants. 
I did also translation research by studying telomeric nuclear architecture in breast cancer for my postdoctoral research. 
Our finding indicate that the profile of telomeric nuclear architecture is better to predict disease free survival 
in luminal A and Luminal B subtypes of breast cancer. I have been working with Dr Landoure team to extensively 
study neuro genetic disorders. Because of the previous grant, we have set up a genetic laboratory having two sectors: 
molecular genetic laboratory and cytogenetic laboratory. The purpose of these laboratories is to be able 
to carry out all of the future genetic testing in Mali for subsequent research studies. In those laboratories, 
we will developed some clinical tests to enhance Malian diagnostic platform. Moreover, these laboratories 
will serve as training sites for students and health care practitioners. "

From 2018 to 2021 she awarded postdoc visiting-fellow position at Dr. Kenneth Fischbeck lab's, at the National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and stroke (NINDS), Neurogenetics branch, National Institute of Health (NIH), U.S.A. 
Her project study at NIH was focus on Malian families with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) features with negative screening data. 
Salimata’s worked on the functional characterization of putative new gene discovered in a Malian consanguineous family with early onset 
of complicated form of HSP features. Her abstract form this project has been highlighted twice as reviewers’ choice abstract author in 
American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) annual meeting 2019 and 2022. In 2021, she was awarded fellow presentation prize in 17th HA3frica meeting. 
Moreover, in August 2021, she was nominee woman leaders in science by Omics data Solution.  
In 2022 to date, she joined Khokha lab at Yale University School of Medicine as research scientist. 
Her project at Yale university is focus on animal model system as human neurodevelopment disease studies including Xenopus Tropicalis and Leavis (Frog).
In addition, she has taken the primarily role in several projects that were and are being published in international journals and presented in high level meetings.
Her interested area goes beyond the HSP study, she is collaborating with other researchers on epilepsy, neurodevelopment disorders, 
gene therapy approach and treatments accessibility to everyone who could benefit, particularly for African population. 
As a future physician-scientist, she hopes to lead a translational lab that develops innovative diagnostics, therapeutics and clinical 
protocols to serve the unmet needs of the patients living with rare and underserved diseases. "
